/*
 * Logging configuration.
 *
 * This example uses two function calls per logged message.  First
 * xLoggingPrintMetadata() attempts to obtain a mutex that grants it access to
 * the output port before outputting metadata about the log.  Second
 * vLoggingPrintf() writes the log message itself before releasing the mutex.
 * These are the prototypes of the functions and the definitions of the macros
 * that call them - there is one macro per severity level.
 *
 * Commenting out the implementation of a macro will omit logging at that level.
 * For example, to remove the most verbose level of logging (DEBUG) simply
 * comment out the implementation of LogDebug() making it an empty macro as
 * shown here:"#define LogDebug( message )"
 *
 * If you want to print out additional metadata then update the
 * xLoggingPrintMetadata() function prototype and implementation so it accepts
 * more parameters, then update the implementation of the macros before to pass
 * the additional information.  For example, if you want the logs to print out
 * the name of the function that called the logging macro then add an additional
 * char * parameter to xLoggingPrintMetadata() function:
 *
 * extern int xLoggingPrintMetadata( const char * const pcLevel,
 *                                   const char * const pcFunctionName ); << new parameter
 *
 * Then update the call to xLoggingPrintMetadata to pass the additional parameter:
 *
 * xLoggingPrintMetadata( "ERROR", __FUNCTION__ ); << Added __FUNCTION__ as second parameter.
 *
 * ....and of course update the implementation of xLoggingPrintMetadata() to
 * actually print the function name passed in to it.
 */
